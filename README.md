# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website project created as part of The Odin Project. It serves as a practice exercise for HTML.

In this project, I will build a simple website that consists of an index page with links to various recipes. Each recipe page will have an image of the dish, a description, a list of ingredients, and steps to prepare the dish. This project will help me solidify my HTML skills.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress, and I plan to style it with CSS in the future.
